# 📊 Wilfrida Were – Portfolio - Tech Capacity

Welcome!  

This repository showcases my **data analytics projects for businesses with advanced technical capabilities**. These businesses have the tools and infrastructure to manage **databases, data warehouses, and automated workflows**, so projects focus on **scalable analytics, automation, and actionable insights using advanced tools**.

For example, these projects might use:

- **SQL databases** to store large volumes of data  
- **Data warehouses** like Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or Azure Synapse Analytics to organize and query large datasets efficiently  
- **Python** for data processing and analysis  
- **ETL pipelines** to automate data workflows  
- **Power BI, Tableau, or Metabase** for interactive dashboards  

The goal is to **deliver insights efficiently at scale** for organizations that can support more complex data systems.
