# ðŸ“Š Wilfrida Were â€“ Portfolio - Tech Capacity

Welcome!  

This repository showcases my **data analytics projects for businesses with advanced technical capabilities**. These organizations have the infrastructure to support **large databases, data warehouses, and automated workflows**, so projects focus on **scalable analytics, automation, and actionable insights using enterprise-grade tools**.  

For example, these businesses might use:  
- **SQL databases** â€“ Store and query large volumes of data  
- **Data warehouses** â€“ Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying at scale  
- **Python** â€“ Data processing, analysis, and automation  
- **ETL pipelines** â€“ Automating data workflows  
- **BI platforms** â€“ Power BI, Tableau, Metabase (enterprise/paid) for interactive dashboards and decision-making  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to deliver insights **efficiently,securely and at scale** for organizations that can support complex data systems.
